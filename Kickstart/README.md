# SecureKickstart: Decentralized Crowdfunding Assurance

SecureKickstart is a decentralized application built on Ethereum using Solidity and Web3, aimed at ensuring the transparency and security of crowdfunding campaigns. It leverages smart contracts to replicate Kickstart campaigns, safeguarding contributors' funds and enabling community-driven decision-making.

## Features

1. **Campaign Creation:**
   - Founders can create new campaigns by specifying a minimum contribution in wei.
   
2. **Contributions:**
   - Investors can contribute to campaigns with a minimum amount set by the founder, either in ether or wei.

3. **Request Creation:**
   - Founders can create expenditure requests by filling out a detailed form, including the purpose of the request, cost in ether, and the recipient address.

4. **Community Approval:**

   - If at least half of the contributors agree to approve a request, the founder can proceed with the specified expenditure.
